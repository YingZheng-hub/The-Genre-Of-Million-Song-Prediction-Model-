# The-Genre-Of-Million-Song-Prediction-Model-
## The Goal of This Project: 
Predicting the genre of songs based on the frequency of words in lyrics by using k-nearest neighbor algorithm 

Coding Process: 

* Explore and upload datasets
* Split data into two datasets such as training and testing set for future classification and evaluation the classification by using pandas package 
* Make sure that training_set and testing_set have a mix of the genres by using python 
* Generate bar-chart by utilizing matplotlib.pyplot for datasets proportion visualization 
# Feature Engineering:
Festures : a collections of words in songs
labels: Hip-hop and Country 
* Compare songs with the frequency of words by using scatterplot 
* Calculate distance in the chart to determine the genre of tested song through NumPy, Pandas
* Finding the genre by computing the mode meaning the most common value by defining functions with python 
* Evaluate the accuracy of the predictions with k = 15,16,7 using k-nearest neighbor algorithm
* Created a Chart  to show the accuracy rate for different choices of k value
